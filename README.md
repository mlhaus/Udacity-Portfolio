# Udacity FEND - Build a Portfolio Site
For this project I developed a responsive website that displays images, descriptions and links to other projects I have completed during and outside the Nanodegree Program.

## What I learned
I learned how to refine my HTML to define "box" placeholders for content on my web page. I mastered skills in CSS to position those boxes and make them look good on multiple devices.
